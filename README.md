# RMTypeDefinitions
RPG Maker MV/MZ type definitions and side note.

This repository currently only contains MZ version, and MV has not started yet.

### rm.d.ts
Basic version.

### rm_comment.d.ts
With method comment(only traditional chinese), but not finish yet.

### rm_protected.d.ts
Use proper `protected` tag for all `_*` attributes and functions, but this is still only planned.

### pixi.js.d.ts
Official PIXI define file, so that the editor will not complain about PIXI not found.
